### A time series analysis of water supply interruptions and cholera incidence

------------------------------------------------------------------------

An analysis of the association between daily variations in the volume of supplied water and incidence of suspected cholera cases in a province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The code reproduces the results of the time series analysis, including the investigation of the exposure-response relationship and the estimation of the excess number of cholera cases, described in the article:
